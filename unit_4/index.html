	<p>Showcasing Her Excellence in Technology is about recognizing the outstanding conrtibutions women have made to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (S.T.E.M.) fields. From playing a major role in helping send the first American astronaut into space to discovering the bacteria that can be engineered to produce human insulin, women have been in the forefront of many major STEM innovations. All without seeking recognition, and always with a smile.</p>

		<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
